=IMPROVEMENTS:=
 * use sysfs instead of trying to "guess" a device's parent
 * report wireless-related information (SSID, channel, AP, mode, etc.) - cf. iwconfig
 * SCSI clean-up (cf. newest versions of sg_utils)
 * on 2.6 kernels, use SG_IO directly on devices, not their sg counterpart
 * for emulated SCSI devices, don't report fake host/channel, just target
 * use businfo to find CPUs instead of hardcoding cpu:n form
 * use sysfs for PCMCIA access
 * use MPTABLE for reporting of CPUs
